Welcome to MTH 122 College Algebra!
We meet on Tuesdays/Thursdays from 10-12:20pm in C256 Graylake campus.

I am so excited to work with you this semester and join you in achieving your academic and personal goals. **Success is not a solo endeavor!** My hopes for this class are that you embark on it with an open mind and are ready to collaborate with your peers and build lasting connections.
