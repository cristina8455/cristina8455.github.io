# MTH 122 College Algebra
## Spring 2025

**Disclaimer:** This syllabus represents my current plans and objectives. As we go through the semester, those plans may need to change to enhance the class learning opportunity. Such changes, communicated clearly, are not unusual and should be expected.

## Course Description
This course is primarily intended to prepare students for Finite Mathematics and Calculus for Business and Social Sciences. This course will also serve as a prerequisite to Trigonometry. College algebra topics include, but are not limited to: conic sections, sequences and series, systems of nonlinear equations, matrix algebra, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions and accompanying equations. Modeling and applications are incorporated throughout the course.

**NOTE:** A specific graphing calculator is required for this course. Contact EMPS Division Office for details. Credit will not be given in MTH 122 to those with prior credit in MTH 144 Precalculus. This course will not meet the General Education Math Requirement for AA or AFA degrees but may serve as an elective. This course with the combination of an IAI MTH course meets the Math requirement for the AS degree.

## Grading Overview
Your overall course grade will be based on your performance on the Homeworks, In Class Activities, Exams and Final Exam.

### Exams
You will have fours exams and a mandatory cumulative final exam. You may not use books, notes, unauthorized calculators, phones, tablets, or software applications during the exams. Each exam is taken in class. Exams include vocabulary, short essay, and problems based on homework and notes. Exams are paper and pencil.

Exam dates are fixed and listed in the course schedule below. Mark these dates on your calendar now and plan accordingly - request time off work, arrange transportation, and avoid scheduling other commitments on these days. If you anticipate any conflicts, contact me immediately rather than waiting until exam day.

| Exam | Date |
|------|------|
| Exam 1 | Tuesday Feb 11th |
| Exam 2 | Tuesday, March 11th |
| Exam 3 | Thursday, April 10th |
| Exam 4 | Thursday, May 1st |

### Alecks Online Homework
Online homework will be assigned after each class session and is due by the start of the next class period. While assignments are designed to be completed between classes, you have until the following week as a final deadline to submit your work. Regular practice through homework is essential for mastering mathematical concepts - problems are carefully selected to reinforce your understanding and build computational fluency. If you find yourself struggling with the material, please utilize office hours, the math tutoring center, or email me to get help early rather than falling behind.

### Written Homeworks
Written homework assignments are designed to develop proper mathematical notation and exam-ready problem-solving skills. You will submit these by scanning all pages into a single PDF using a scanning app and uploading to Canvas. Solutions will be posted 48 hours after the deadline, so no late work can be accepted. If you need an extension due to extenuating circumstances, email me before the deadline.

To address extenuating circumstances, one written assignments grade will be dropped.

### In Class Group Activities
In class group activities can be in the form of a:

**Group quiz:** Group quizzes will be completed and submitted during class with randomly assigned teams. These hand-written assignments cover material from homework, notes, and the textbook, with all group members receiving the same grade. Group work provides valuable opportunities to both teach and learn from peers at different skill levels. Teaching others reinforces your own understanding, while learning from classmates offers fresh perspectives. This collaborative environment helps everyone succeed, as mathematics is inherently strengthened through teamwork and shared understanding.

**Individual Quiz:** Individual quizzes will be given throughout the semester and announced during the previous class period. These closed-note assessments are designed to familiarize you with exam-style questions and time constraints. Quizzes serve as checkpoints to ensure you're keeping pace with the material and give you targeted practice with the types of problems you'll encounter on exams.

**Other activities:** Throughout the semester, we'll engage in various interactive learning activities including games, Kahoot, and mathematical simulations. These activities are designed to reinforce concepts through collaborative learning and will be graded based on your active participation rather than correct answers. Showing up and engaging with the material is what matters for these assignments.

In class activities are meant to be done in class, thus one cannot make-up in class activities. However, some of each of the in class activities type grades will be dropped to account for unforeseen circumstances that prevent you from attending class.

### Final Exam
The Final Exam is a cumulative final that covers all the material. The final is set up like the unit exams but covers more material. Final must be taken to receive a passing grade (A, B, C, or D).

**Final Exam is on Tuesday, May 13 at 10-11:50am.**

### Grade Distribution and Scale

| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Best 3 out of 4 Exams | 45% |
| Alecks Homework | 15% |
| Written Homeworks | 10% |
| In class group activities | 10% |
| Final exam | 20% |

| Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| A | > 89.5% |
| B | > 79.5% |
| C | > 69.5% |
| D | > 59.5% |
| F | below 59.5% |

## Late Work Policies
Extensions will be granted on a case-by-case basis and is situation dependent. I understand that things come up, and communication is essential. Emailing me to communicate your situation (if possible before the missed class/assignment) is your responsibility, but not a guarantee of an extension. (csizemore@clcillinois.edu). There are no make-ups for in class activities but a few lowest grades will be dropped at the end of the semester. There is no make-up for exams. Three best exams scores out of the four semester exams will be kept. While this policy provides a safety net for an off day or unexpected circumstances, you should plan to take all four exams. Missing an exam intentionally removes your buffer against illness, emergencies, or underperformance on a later test. Be strategic - take every exam and give yourself the best chance at success in the course.

## Withdrawing from the Class: There are 3 types of Withdrawals
Withdrawing from a class means that you no longer want to be enrolled in the class. Your transcript and the grade for the course may vary depending on the time at which you withdraw or request to withdraw from a course. The table below briefly outlines the actions you must take and the potential outcomes if you decide to withdraw from this course. I can help with understanding the difference. We can discuss different options if you are unsure.

## Withdrawing from Class
You are responsible for dropping or withdrawing from classes you do not intend to complete. Grades of W will only be assigned to students who withdraw themselves. Tuition and fee refunds will be issued to eligible students based upon the effective date of withdrawal, which is recorded in the system at the time the student drops the class.

Instructors are required to administratively withdraw students who never attended or stopped attending class. All administratively withdrawn courses will remain on your academic record and are not eligible for a refund. Grades will be assigned based on dates of attendance:

- WN – You never attended class: no impact on GPA
- WS – You stopped attending class: no impact on GPA 
- FW – You stopped attending class after the official withdraw deadline and your instructor deems you failing: equivalent of F grade for GPA.

In order to withdraw and receive a grade of W after the deadline, you must request a withdrawal from your instructor; requests must be made in writing and additional approvals may be required. You must have a passing grade at the time the withdrawal request is made. Once approved, you will be withdrawn from class.
